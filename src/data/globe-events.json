    "description": "Markets price a 29% probability of a nationwide general strike in Indonesia before end of 2026, triggered by rising cost-of-living from US tariff retaliations affecting Indonesian commodity exports. Palm oil, coal, and nickel exports — which together account for 34% of export earnings — face compounding headwinds from both US and EU carbon border adjustment mechanisms.",
